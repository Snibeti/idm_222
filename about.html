	<p class="about_text">I am currently at Drexel University in the Interactive Digital Media program, with a minor in Marketing. I love all things design, and like making more traditional art in my free time.<br><br>I would describe myself as curious, hard-working, and extremely ambitious. My work lies mainly with website design, but I am looking to branch out into other digital/graphic design mediums, so I can learn and take inspiration from such processes.<br><br>Although I'm a full time student, I try to take on freelance work whenever I can. If you like my work and are interested in working on a project with me, shoot me an email at: <a href="mailto:sabraydesign@gmail.com">sabraydesign@gmail.com.</a></p><br><br>
